# LIME-SHAP-Evaluation

The aim of this project is to evaluate the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) both quantitatively using the LEAF framework (Local Explanation evAluation Framework) and qualitatively by interpreting the LIME and SHAP explanation.

## Steps for Qualitative Evaluation
- Re-processing Images
- Building the Black-Box Models
- Classification the images with the Black-Box-Modells
- Explaining the Decisions of the Black-Box Models Using LIME and SHAP

## Steps for Quanitativ Evaluation
- Re-processing Images
- Converting the images into a tabular form
- Building the Black-Box Models
- Classification the tabular data with the Black-Box Models
- Using LEAF to Calculate the stability and the fidelity in order to evaluate LIME & SHAP
  
## To run the code: 
- Install Libraries in your environment using pip install -r requirements.txt
- Import the required librariers in the importing libraries section.
- That's it! Now you're ready to run the code.
